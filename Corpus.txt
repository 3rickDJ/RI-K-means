WVkountrykamping 03 27 2023 Awesome book Lin Stepp has really outdone herself on this book I believe it is the best book she has ever written and I have read all her books Not that I am a expert but I am a high volume reader I do relate to this story because I am part Cherokee my great grandmother was a full blooded Cherokee I think the research she did for this book was spot on It touched my heart of all the history she had to research to make this book what it is It is a fast read or it was for me It kept my interest and is a page turner I love the characters she had in this book and it makes me want to go to Cherokee NC to meet these people She made them all seem so real to me I could really see these people as the Cherokee families that live there The thing about the grandma having site it is so true that Cherokee have that I also have a small part of that mine is a little different I have had site but mostly I have feelings and know things about people I feel them and know what kind of person they might be You will not be disappointed in this book it is worth every penny I believe this book would be a good read at the beach or a vacation trip anywhere or just sitting on your porch enjoying the outside or even by a fire when the snow is flying Lin s books are fun reads and I have said that about her books for years and this one is no different It is also is informative of some of the Cherokee people Love this book peytonlam 01 22 2023 Great if you re willing to give up some time This app is one of my main apps I personally read consistently everyday and I LOVE to log my books online I personally hated logging my books in elementary school on paper But this has so many exceptions For the people looking to see what the heck this app even does you can add friends to see books they re reading and if you want can compete You can ofc log books You cannot read books this is not an online library But it seriously has EVERY BOOK EVER TO BE WRITTEN Not for you to read but to update your book status If you put in your page number it will tell you the percentage you re in your book There are three different shelves you can put a book under Want to read Read and Currently Reading There s annual challenges like the 2023 reading challenge where you can set a goal of how many books you want to read in the year and it will log them I love this and I beg you to get it There s no fees at all You also can see recommended books for you based on your previous read books so they figure your taste It may be incorrect at first but I now get great recommendations that I would totally read All my bookworms get this right now bookzNERD 07 27 2023 Love it but I ve got some ideas Don t get me wrong this app is helpful and I use it all the times but it can be pretty clunky sometimes The featured booklists on your page are kinda tricky to find again and I wish there was a whole tab for them with like recently viewed lists and recommendations and things like that because when you accidentally leave an amazing list and can t find it it s the worst The biggest issue I have is it s not the most new user friendly I got this app and had so many books and shelves to create for my previous reads but it takes five clicks to add a book to a shelf When I make a shelf it s because I realize I have lots of books similar and so scrolling through my reads and clicking five times for each is not fun at all and takes all day I wish there was a select tool so you could add multiple books to a shelf at a time this would probably make this review five stars Another little issue I have and maybe I just can t figure it out is Re reading If I read a book multiple times why can t I count both towards my reading challenge It won t be an accurate page count if it turns out that was just the one of the times I read the book that year I feel like you should have multiple reading dates on your book info so it isn t just showing the last time you read it If this is a feature and I just haven t found it then I apologize Definitely needs a refresh I just looked at version history and it s mostly bug fixes This app NEEDS something new App Privacy The
